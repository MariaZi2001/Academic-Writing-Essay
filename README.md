# Trump 2025 Inaugural Speech – Linguistic Analysis

This notebook analyzes Donald Trump’s 2025 inaugural speech using simple Python tools. It focuses on how language creates group identity through:

- **Pronoun Analysis**: Counts of in-group (*we*, *our*) and out-group (*they*, *them*) words.
- **Word Frequency**: Shows the top 10 most used content words (without stopwords).
- **Visualization**: Bar chart to compare pronoun usage.

The project uses web scraping to get the speech text and applies basic text processing to explore political language. It follows ideas from Critical Discourse Analysis.
